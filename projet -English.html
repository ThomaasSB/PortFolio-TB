                <h2>Context</h2>
                <br><br/>
                <p>In February 2024, we studied data extraction from Google Maps for businesses using advanced web scraping techniques. We developed a robust and efficient Python script that leverages Selenium and the Address API to automate the extraction process. This approach allowed us to accurately and efficiently extract relevant information such as geographic coordinates, opening hours, customer reviews, and other useful details from Google Maps pages.

                    To handle the large volumes of data generated by this extraction, we implemented a partitioning strategy. This method divided the processing into smaller manageable segments, optimizing performance and ensuring smooth execution even with large data files. This approach maximized processing efficiency while preserving the accuracy of the collected data.
                    
                    Alongside script development, we deployed the solution in a production environment suitable for handling large files. This step allowed us to test and validate our solution under real conditions, ensuring its reliability and operational effectiveness.
                    
                    Finally, to report on the results and insights derived from this data, we produced a detailed report. This report includes an in-depth analysis of the extracted information, relevant visualizations, and recommendations based on the findings. This approach helped to showcase the collected data and draw strategic conclusions for our clients.</p>

                <p>In February 2024, our team focused on an in-depth analysis of time series data, particularly the evolution of solar energy production over the years. We developed custom R code, employing advanced techniques such as seasonality detection, trend identification, error estimation, and importantly, future trend forecasting in solar production. By using forecasting models such as ARMA and Holt-Winters, we accurately anticipated expected changes in solar energy production. Our results were consolidated into a detailed report, highlighting key insights, methodologies employed, and solar production forecasts to guide investment and development strategies in renewable energy. This time series analysis contributes significantly to understanding and planning the continued expansion of solar energy in the modern energy landscape.</p>

                <p>During my first year, I acquired various skills that were put to the test during a significant project throughout my second semester, from February 2023 to June 2023. This project consisted of two parts: project management where I acted as the lead, and analysis where I assumed the role of an analyst.

                    In project management, I led a team to develop a detailed report documenting our journey. I initiated a tentative schedule identifying key milestones for a realistic approach to our deadlines. Explaining our organizational choices and tools used, including methods like Waterfall and fixed-price delivery, was crucial. This aspect greatly enriched my project management skills and strengthened my leadership. 
                    
                    As for statistical analysis, we received a database on state-guaranteed loans after the COVID health crisis. My initial task was to perform descriptive analysis to identify trends and prepare our response to the issue. This involved data cleaning, excluding inconsistent information and unnecessary variables, followed by choosing appropriate graphical representations. We then conducted bivariate analyses to establish correlations between different data, including the distribution of loans by regions, departments, and sectors. I also performed linear regression to better understand the interactions between these variables.
                    
                    This project significantly strengthened my statistical analysis skills, encompassing various concepts and the use of software such as RStudio and SAS. Additionally, the design component was valued, encouraging our creativity through tools like Canva or Photoshop. Rigor and organization were pillars throughout this project to meet the set deadlines.</p>

                <p>In the context of my apprenticeship, I was tasked with creating a reporting concerning a rather significant database from Médiamétrie, called BaBU (Base Usage Base Adresses).</p>
                <p>This database contains numerous addresses (phone numbers/emails) and personal data. For studies, we receive numerous requests for counting (reporting on the number of available addresses, considering that an address can only be contacted once per year). The aim of this reporting is to provide a user-friendly tool to our collaborators to facilitate access and gain autonomy. To achieve this, I had to extract data from the database using the usual filters to exclude certain address profiles. Subsequently, I created a dashboard using Power BI. The objective of this process is automation, which is why I used a new tool, Power Automate, allowing us to create flows and execute tasks automatically (email sending, dataset refresh).</p>
